  *
  *
  * Limitations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV
  * The WAV format is limited to files that are less than 4 GB,
  * because of its use of a 32-bit unsigned integer to record the file size header (some programs limit the file size to 2 GB).
  * 
  * The W64 format was therefore created for use in Sound Forge. Its 64-bit header allows for much longer recording times.
  * The RF64 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF64) format specified by the European Broadcasting Union has also been created to solve this problem.

 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * TagLib is a library for reading and editing audio meta data, commonly know as \e tags.
 *
 * Features:
 * - A clean, high level, C++ API to handling audio meta data.
 * - Format specific APIs for advanced API users.
 * - ID3v1, ID3v2, APE, FLAC, Xiph, iTunes-style MP4 and WMA tag formats.
 * - MP3, MPC, FLAC, MP4, ASF, AIFF, WAV, TrueAudio, WavPack, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, Speex and Opus file formats.
 * - Basic audio file properties such as length, sample rate, etc.
 * - Long term binary and source compatibility.
 * - Extensible design, notably the ability to add other formats or extend current formats as a library user.
 * - Full support for unicode and internationalized tags.
 * - Dual <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html">MPL</a> and
 *   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">LGPL</a> licenses.
 * - No external toolkit dependencies.
 *
 * \section why Why TagLib?
 *
 * TagLib originally was written to provide an updated and improved ID3v2 implementation in C++ for use
 * in a variety of Open Source projects.  Since development began in 2002 and the 1.0 release in 2004
 * it has expanded to cover a wide variety of tag and file formats and is used in a wide variety of
 * Open Source and proprietary applications.  It now supports a variety of UNIXes, including Apple's OS
 * X, as well as Microsoft Windows.
 *
 * \section commercial Usage in Commercial Applications
 *
 * TagLib's licenses \e do allow usage within propriety (\e closed) applications, however TagLib is \e not
 * public domain.  Please note the requirements of the LGPL or MPL, and adhere to at least one of them.
 * In simple terms, you must at a minimum note your usage of TagLib, note the licensing terms of TagLib and
 * if you make changes to TagLib publish them.  Please review the licenses above before using TagLib in your
 * software.  Note that you may choose either the MPL or the LGPL, you do not have to fulfill the
 * requirements of both.
 *
 * \section installing Installing TagLib
 *
 * Please see the <a href="http://taglib.org/">TagLib website</a> for the latest
 * downloads.
 *
 * TagLib can be built using the CMake build system. TagLib installs a taglib-config and pkg-config file to
 * make it easier to integrate into various build systems.  Note that TagLib's include install directory \e must
 * be included in the header include path. Simply adding <taglib/tag.h> will \e not work.
 *
 * \section start Getting Started
 *
 * TagLib provides both simple, abstract APIs which make it possible to ignore the differences between tagging
 * formats and format specific APIs which allow programmers to work with the features of specific tagging
 * schemes.  There is a similar abstraction mechanism for AudioProperties.
 *
 * The best place to start is with the <b>Class Hierarchy</b> linked at the top of the page.  The File and
 * AudioProperties classes and their subclasses are the core of TagLib.  The FileRef class is also a convenient
 * way for using a value-based handle.
 *
 * \note When working with FileRef please consider that it has only the most basic (extension-based) file
 * type resolution.  Please see its documentation on how to plug in more advanced file type resolution.  (Such
 * resolution may be part of later TagLib releases by default.)
 *
 * Here's a very simple example with TagLib:
 *
 * \code
 *
 * TagLib::FileRef f("Latex Solar Beef.mp3");
 * TagLib::String artist = f.tag()->artist(); // artist == "Frank Zappa"
 *
 * f.tag()->setAlbum("Fillmore East");
 * f.save();
 *
 * TagLib::FileRef g("Free City Rhymes.ogg");
 * TagLib::String album = g.tag()->album(); // album == "NYC Ghosts & Flowers"
 *
 * g.tag()->setTrack(1);
 * g.save();
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * More examples can be found in the \e examples directory of the source distribution.
